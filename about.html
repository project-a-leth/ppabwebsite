        <h2> Our Story </h2>
        <p> Petals, Paws & Beans Story is one that started out when my family had
           our first Greenhouse. My mom always wanted to have a coffee shop that
           was intertwined with flowers. When our greenhouse was open we didn't
           sell coffee but ice cream instead, but not just any ice cream brand.
           We wanted the best and so we did. FootHills ice cream was what we
           sold and man that was a seller. I still remember as a little girl
           scooping out ice cream for customers, and seeing them walk away with
           smiles. Those were the best times. In the future we hope to sell
           FootHills ice cream as well. <br><br>
           For a long time my mom had held on to this dream that one day her
           coffee shop would come alive. I as her daughter decided to take that
           dream and make it a reality. So in 2019 we decided to open up a
           coffee shop that would be connected to New Hope YQL flower shop.
           My sister who owns the flower shop was estactice of the idea. When
           we decided to make the coffee shop no one wanted to invest in this
           venture of ours. It was indeed frustrating. However I never gave up              and we used everything that we could to start construction.
           Everything that is inside Petals, Paws & Beans has been repurposed.
           We had so much help from family friends and just people in the
           community helping us. I am beyond grateful for everyone's help.
           As of November 27th 2020 Petals,Paw & Beans is up and running.
           So looking forward to meeting every single one of you.</p>
